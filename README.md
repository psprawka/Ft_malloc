# Ft_malloc - allocate and free dynamic memory â›“

This project is about writing a dynamic allocation memory management library; recoding two of most commonly used functions - malloc() and free() along red black trees.


# THIS PROJECT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN - I started to restructure it, but don't have time to finish, so it is in the middle of restructuring. I'll fix it once I have time for it :)
